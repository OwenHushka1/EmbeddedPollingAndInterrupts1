This is an embedded C project written for the STM32F429ZITx FPGA board. The goal of the project was to practice implementing polling and interrupts. 
This project has a macro called USE_INTERRUPT_FOR_BUTTON which switches the program between using interrupts and using polling. 
This project additionally is meant to give practice with compile switches.
